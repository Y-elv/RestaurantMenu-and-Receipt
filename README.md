# RestaurantMenu-and-Receipt

This project is a C++ console-based application for a restaurant menu and ordering system. The app allows customers to choose their preferred language (English or Kinyarwanda) and view the menu items in their selected language. Customers can then place their food and drink orders, specifying the quantity for each item.

Features:

Language Selection: Users can choose between English and Kinyarwanda as their preferred language for the menu.
Display Menu: The app displays a list of available food and drink items along with their corresponding prices.
Ordering System: Customers can order multiple items and specify the quantity for each item they wish to purchase.
Total Calculation: The app calculates the total cost of the order based on the selected items and their quantities.
Subtotals: For each ordered item, the app provides subtotals indicating the individual cost of each item.
User-Friendly Interface: The app offers a simple and easy-to-use interface for smooth interaction.

How to Use:

Choose Language: When the app is launched, users will be prompted to choose their preferred language (English or Kinyarwanda).
View Menu: The app will display the menu with food and drink items along with their prices in the selected language.
Place Orders: Users can enter the item number and quantity to place their orders. They can continue adding items until they are ready to finish the order.
Complete Order: To complete the order, users can enter 0 as the item number, and the app will provide the total cost of the order.

Instructions for Developers:

The project is written in C++ and is designed to run on the console.
The main logic resides in the main() function, while the menu display and ordering functions are defined in separate functions.
The menu items and their prices are stored in a map data structure for easy retrieval and calculation.
Developers can modify the menu items and prices in the map to customize the menu according to the restaurant's offerings.
Additional features, such as handling discounts, adding new menu items, or storing orders in a file, can be implemented to enhance the application's functionality.
